/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC721 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures.
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC721 allowance (see {IERC721-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC721-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * This implementation was inspired by openzeppelin's ERC20PermitUpgradeable.
 * This interface will likely be deprecated after the official implementation is released by openzeppelin.
 * Make sure to implement your smart contracts accordingly to be able to upgrade it properly.
